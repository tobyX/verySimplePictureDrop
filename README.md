# verySimplePictureDrop
a very simple script to drop pictures using dropzone.js

Just change $uploadDir in upload.php to your picture dir.

Users must provide a "name" which will be the name of the folder their pictures will be stored.

There is some sanitation for the given values (name and filename), but the pictures will not be
checked for malicious content!

It checks for duplicate filenames and adds a number to avoid overwriting of existing files.

As this script is for a friend of mine robots are not allowed to index this site. ;)
